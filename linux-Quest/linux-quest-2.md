# The Real Quest Begins

## Quest 2: Part 1 The Setup

First things first theres some environment setup you need to do. I.E the hints. 

Please run the following command:

|=============================|
|                             |
|  bash linux-quest/setup.sh  |
|  source ~/.bashrc           |
|                             |
|=============================|

Now we've done some simple commands, but theres a lot more to do! 

Like any good Architect/Dev you need to set up correctly. so lets do so now! 

first things first, we need to make some directories (Folders) for all our new data!

The file structure should look something like this:

|===============================================|
|      Tree           |          ls             |
|  —quests            |   /quests               |
|    ⊢—quest1         |   /quests/quest1        |
|        ⊢—file1      |   /quests/quest1/file1  |
|        ⊢—file2      |   /quests/quest1/file2  |
|    ⊢—quest2         |   /quests/quest2        |
|        ⊢—game       |   /quests/quest2/game   |
|    ⊢—quest3         |   /quests/quest3        |
|        ⊢—quest3     |   /quests/quest3/       |
|                     |                         |
|===============================================|

If your stuck run the command:

|=====================|
|         Hint        |
|  printenv hintQ2P1  |
|                     |
|       Answer        |
| printenv answerQ2P1 |
|                     |
|=====================|

Now you have it all setup use tree or ls to see if it looks the same

You should run 'Cat linux-quest-2p2.md'
