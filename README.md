## First steps are to get some things installed:

I recommend getting a few things installed, like: 

* [Putty](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) 
    * ~# if that didnt work please click [Here](https://www.putty.org)

* Within VSCode you may want to install the aws toolkit, simply search this extention ID in the extensions tab
```
amazonwebservices.aws-toolkit-vscode
```
